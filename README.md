## About our project

We developed this project during the 2023 ShellHacks Hackathon.
Our application consists of several key features that allow you to get started, or excel at FPL, some of those include:

- **Squad Optimization:** Use our squad optimization tool to find the perfect balance between premium and budget players. Maximize your team's potential while staying within your budget.
- **Comprehensive Statistics:** Access detailed player statistics, including historical performance, goal involvement, and bonus point potential. Make data-driven decisions and uncover hidden gems for your squad.
- **News and Analysis:** Stay informed with the latest FPL news and expert analysis. Get insights from FPL pundits to help you stay ahead of the competition
- **Accesible Ruleset:** Allows the uninitiated to understand the basic rules of the game and get started at any time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
